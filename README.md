# bigmart_sales_prediction

1. Project Overview
This project focuses on building a predictive model to forecast the sales of various products at different BigMart stores. By analyzing historical sales data alongside product and store attributes, the aim is to identify key properties that influence sales, thereby enabling BigMart to optimize product placement, inventory, and marketing strategies to drive revenue growth.

2. Problem Statement
BigMart has collected 2013 sales data for numerous products across many stores. They need a robust predictive model to accurately estimate the sales of each product at a particular store. This understanding will be crucial for BigMart to gain insights into which product and store characteristics are most effective in increasing sales, allowing for data-driven business decisions.

3. Objective
Understand and Clean Dataset: Perform thorough data understanding, cleaning, and preprocessing.
Build Regression Models: Develop and train various regression models to predict Item_Outlet_Sales.
Evaluate and Compare Models: Assess model performance using relevant regression metrics (R2, RMSE, MAE) and compare their effectiveness.
Derive Business Insights: Identify key product and store properties that significantly impact sales.

4. Dataset
The dataset is sourced from Kaggle: BigMart Sales Dataset.
It contains 2013 sales data with various product and store attributes.

Columns and Definitions:

Item_Identifier: Unique ID for each item.
Item_Weight: Weight of the item (in grams).
Item_Fat_Content: Describes if the item is low fat or regular.
Item_Visibility: The percentage of total display area of all products in a store allocated to the particular product (higher visibility implies better placement).
Item_Type: The category to which the item belongs (e.g., Fruits and Vegetables, Snack Foods).
Item_MRP: Maximum Retail Price (list price) of the item.
Outlet_Identifier: Unique ID for each store.
Outlet_Establishment_Year: The year in which the store was established.
Outlet_Size: The size of the store (Small, Medium, High).
Outlet_Location_Type: The type of city in which the store is located (Tier 1, 2, or 3).
Outlet_Type: The type of outlet (e.g., Supermarket Type1, Grocery Store).
Item_Outlet_Sales: Target Variable - Sales of the product in a particular store.

5. Methodology
The project follows a structured data analysis and machine learning workflow:
Data Loading & Initial Inspection
Loads train.csv and test.csv into Pandas DataFrames.
Performs initial checks using .head(), .info(), .describe(), and .isnull().sum() to understand data structure, types, summary statistics, and identify missing values.
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
Missing Values:
Handles missing Item_Weight values (e.g., by imputing with the mean/median weight for each Item_Type).
Handles missing Outlet_Size values (e.g., by imputing with the mode for each Outlet_Type or Outlet_Location_Type).
Inconsistent Data: Addresses inconsistencies in Item_Fat_Content (e.g., standardizing 'low fat', 'LF', 'reg' to 'Low Fat', 'Regular').
Outliers: Investigates and potentially handles outliers in numerical columns like Item_Visibility and Item_MRP.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Univariate Analysis: Visualizes distributions of individual features (histograms for numerical, count plots for categorical).
Bivariate Analysis: Explores relationships between features and the target variable (Item_Outlet_Sales):
Sales trends by Item_Type, Outlet_Type, Outlet_Location_Type, Outlet_Size.
Impact of Item_MRP, Item_Weight, Item_Visibility on sales.
Sales distribution across different Outlet_Identifiers.
Correlation Analysis: Generates a correlation heatmap for numerical features.
Feature Engineering
Outlet_Age: Derives Outlet_Age from Outlet_Establishment_Year (e.g., Current_Year - Outlet_Establishment_Year).
Item_Visibility Adjustment: If Item_Visibility has zero values (which is unrealistic for a visible product), these might be imputed or treated specially.
Categorical Encoding:
One-Hot Encoding for nominal categorical features (Item_Type, Outlet_Type, Outlet_Location_Type, Outlet_Size, Item_Fat_Content).
Label Encoding for ordinal categorical features if applicable (though One-Hot is safer for most).
Dropping Redundant Features: Removes original Outlet_Establishment_Year and Item_Identifier (after using it for imputation if needed).
Model Building (Regression)
Feature & Target Split: Separates features (X) from the target variable (y - Item_Outlet_Sales).
Train-Test Split: Divides the preprocessed data into training and testing sets.
Feature Scaling: Applies StandardScaler to numerical features to normalize their range, crucial for many regression algorithms.
Model Selection & Training:
Linear Regression: A baseline linear model.
Decision Tree Regressor: A non-linear, interpretable model.
Random Forest Regressor: An ensemble method known for high accuracy and robustness.
(Optional: Gradient Boosting Regressor like XGBoost/LightGBM for potentially higher performance).
Model Evaluation & Comparison
Prediction: Generates predictions on the test set using each trained model.
Metrics: Evaluates model performance using standard regression metrics:
R-squared (R2 Score): Explains the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that can be predicted from the independent variables.
Mean Squared Error (MSE): Average of the squared differences between predicted and actual values.
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): Square root of MSE, providing error in the same units as the target variable.
Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Average of the absolute differences between predicted and actual values.
Comparison: Compares the performance of different models to identify the best-performing one based on chosen metrics.

6. Key Findings & Business Insights
The analysis aims to reveal insights into factors driving sales, such as:
High-Impact Product Attributes: Which Item_Types, Item_Fat_Contents, or Item_MRP ranges are associated with higher sales?
Optimal Store Characteristics: What Outlet_Types, Outlet_Sizes, or Outlet_Location_Types tend to generate more sales?
Outlet Age Influence: Does the age of an outlet (Outlet_Age) affect its sales performance?
Visibility Impact: How does Item_Visibility correlate with Item_Outlet_Sales?
Actionable Recommendations: Provide concrete suggestions for BigMart, such as:
Prioritizing stocking and marketing for specific product types in certain store configurations.
Optimizing pricing strategies based on Item_MRP's impact.
Improving product placement for items with low Item_Visibility but high sales potential.
Strategic expansion plans based on successful outlet characteristics.
